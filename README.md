#### Game story

Elize was the youngest of 5 siblings in a small countryside village called Tilltington in rural Brittain, her older brothers all joined the airforce. All she wanted was to be as her brothers but everyone told her this was impossible..."your a girl, you cant be a pilot sweetie. Why dont you want to be a nurse like all the other girls?". 

Elize's brothers took her up in their fighter planes on weekends, they even taught her how to fly the plane and soon she was as good as them.

One day the war came and all her brothers left in a hurry. Elize had an idea...

Dressed in her brothers pilot clothes she looked like a pilot especially with the cap pulled down and a scarf around her neck. Nobody really questioned her as she passed the guard at the airfield. As she stepped into the cockpit of the P-51 she knew this would be rough and tough but she was going to be a real pilot just like everyone said she could not be...
